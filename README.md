Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 3.5/5 stars and stated that "On the whole, GO GOA GONE is experimental since something like this has never been attempted earlier. But it’s fun, witty, amusing and yes, thoroughly entertaining". Meena Iyer of Times of India gave it 3 out of 5 stars and said "Go Goa Gone is positively different from anything you have seen before. And for the young and restless or even those who like whacked-out fun, it’s a great ride.". Namrata Joshi of Outlook rated the film 3 out of 5 stars and summarised by saying "It's fun, sharp, smart and irreverant. Go Goa Gone pushes many of our sanctimonious envelopes." 

Rajeev Masand gave the film a 3/5 rating and wrote, "So much in this film is good, until it all goes nowhere in the end." 

Shubir Rishi of Rediff.com gave it 2.5/5 stars and said "Go Goa Gone" is a fun watch. There are plenty of innocent-sounding, slow-exploding one-liners, which are funny". Anupama Chopra of Hindustan Times gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars stating that, "The problem with Go Goa Gone is too much cleverness and not enough plot. Shubhra Gupta The Indian Express rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, "The film would have been funnier if the second act hadn't gone into a slide. And also if Khan hadn't played Boris so straight."
